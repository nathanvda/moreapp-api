# moreapp-api

> A simple gem to interface with the MoreApp REST API. 

## Introduction

The [moreapp API documentation](https://docs.moreapp.com/) is pretty good and easy to read. They have some example implementations,
but at the moment not for ruby.

While accessing the API is pretty easy and straightforward using the `OAuth` gem, for some I struggled to get it working at first.
So hopefully this gem will help future users of the moreapp API at least to get started quicker.

For now, the gem's main purpose is to provide a very basic and simple interface to `moreapp`,
for my own limited interactions/needs.



## Todo

* add tests :)
* add more API entries?
* add better documentation?
